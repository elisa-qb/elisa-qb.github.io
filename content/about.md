**Physicist by training**, inspired by Schrödinger’s What is Life?, I’ve always been driven by the ambition to describe living systems with logic and mathematics.

When AI unlocked new ways to analyze complex biomedical data, I pursued a **PhD in Data Science** to apply this approach to healthcare.
I later founded [QuantaBrain](https://quantabrain.org), developing AI tools to support the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders from functional MRI.

**I deeply believe that psychiatry represents the most critical unmet medical need of our time. Not because it is necessarily more severe than cancer, but because the brain is the organ that most defines us as human. It is nearly impossible to study it in animal models, and it is the only organ protected by an exoskeleton, making it difficult to study in vivo in humans.**

There is a tremendous need for innovation in this field, and I want to be part of the revolution that will transform it.

This is not just my mission — it’s my life.

Happy to connect with healthcare innovators, patient advocates, startup experts, and anyone fully committed to a cause they believe is urgent.
